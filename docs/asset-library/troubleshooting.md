# Troubleshooting

## My Asset Library is out of sync
If you do not see the assets you expect in your Asset Library, you may need to:
- Wait up to 5 minutes for the assets to be uploaded.
- (Advanced) If you are still experiencing issues, head to the advanced section of your course or project, and click `Open GitLab Project`.

Once you are in the GitLab repository of your project, follow [these instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/#view-pipelines) and restart the latest failed pipeline.
  - if the pipeline is still failing, please try again later or contact support.
