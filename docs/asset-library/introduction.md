# Introduction

The labs, images and all other assets you create for your course or project are uploaded to the **Asset Library**. With Asset Library, you get a single place to **view all your assets and grab the links you need** to use them in your course or project.

<!-- TODO: remove the reference to gitlab when it is phased out. -->
To get started with the Asset Library, you will need to have assets in your course. This can be a lab or any file in the GitLab repository of your project. Once your assets are ready, you can go to the details page of your course or guided project and click the `Open Asset Library` button.
